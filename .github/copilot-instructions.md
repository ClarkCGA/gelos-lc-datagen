# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Architecture Overview

Consult `README.md` if it exists for an overview of the project architecture and purpose.

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

**Important:** Always check for `.agent-module/` directory commands before starting work. These commands provide structured workflows for:
- Feature planning and implementation
- GitHub issue and PR management
- Commit conventions and branch naming
- Testing and validation procedures

If `.agent-module/` directory exists, follow those commands for consistent workflow.

When the user explicitly invokes any of these slash-commands (for example `/plan-feature` or `/execute`), Copilot must:

- Locate the corresponding command file under `.agent-module/commands`
- Read and treat its contents as the authoritative workflow for that action
- Follow the command’s process and steps explicitly and completely to fulfill the instruction, except where doing so would conflict with higher-priority safety or system rules

When the user informally mentions a command name (for example "prime", "plan feature", "execute the plan", "run RCA"), Copilot should:

- Infer whether the user likely intends to run the corresponding .agent-module command
- If the intent is clear and appropriate in context, locate and follow that command as above
- Optionally ask for quick confirmation if intent is ambiguous (e.g., "Do you want me to run `/prime` now?")

## Assistant Behavior & Collaboration Guidelines

- Default to concise explanations; for non-trivial or multi-file work, briefly outline a numbered plan before executing changes.
- When requirements are ambiguous, ask at most 1–2 targeted clarification questions and clearly state any assumptions before proceeding.
- For substantial features or refactors, consult project docs (for example `docs/`, `.agents/`, and `.github/` files) before deciding on an approach.
- After code changes, recommend or run appropriate tests (unit, integration, or smoke) when feasible, and state exactly what was run and the outcome.
- Avoid schema, migration, or production-impacting changes (databases, secrets, billing, auth) unless the user explicitly requests them.
- Prefer small, focused changes aligned with the current request; avoid unrelated refactors unless the user approves.
- Preserve existing style and patterns in this repo unless there is an explicit decision to migrate to a new pattern.

### Core PIV Loop Commands

- `/prime` - Prime the core planning/implementation loop
- `/plan-feature` - Create comprehensive implementation plans (no code)
- `/execute` - Implement from an approved plan

### Product Requirements & Documentation Commands

- `/create-prd` - Create or update a Product Requirements Document for a feature

### Git & Issue Workflow Commands

- `/commit` - Create conventional commits following project rules
- `/github-issue-create` - Create GitHub issues from plans
- `/github-feature-branch` - Create properly named feature branches
- `/github-pr-create` - Create PRs with proper linking and description

### Bug Fix Workflow Commands

- `/rca` - Perform root cause analysis for a bug
- `/implement-fix` - Implement and validate a targeted bug fix

### Validation & Review Commands

- `/code-review` - Perform structured code review
- `/code-review-fix` - Apply fixes based on review findings
- `/execution-report` - Summarize what was executed and its effects
- `/system-review` - Review system-level risks, architecture, and impacts
- `/validate` - Run validation and testing workflows

## Git Workflow for Issue Development

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Work from Feature Branches

**NEVER work directly on `main` branch. Always create a feature branch for each issue.**

### Starting Work on a New Issue

Follow these steps **in order**:

**Step 1: Fetch Latest Changes**
```bash
git fetch origin
```

**Step 2: Switch to Main and Pull Latest**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**Step 3: Create Feature Branch**
Create a branch that references the issue number:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/issue-XX-description
# or
git checkout -b feature/issue-XX-description
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/issue-XX-short-description`
- **Features**: `feature/issue-XX-short-description`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/issue-XX-short-description`

**Examples:**
- `fix/issue-28-populate-parameter-format`
- `feature/issue-45-supabase-subscriptions-schema`
- `refactor/issue-24-zod-peer-dependency`

**Step 4: Start Work**
Only after the feature branch is created, start making changes.

**Step 5: Code Quality Checks**
Run all quality checks before completion:
```bash
# First auto-format and commit any formatting changes
npm run format
git add .
git commit -m "style: format code"  # Only if there were formatting changes

# Then run final verification checks
npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run build && npm test
```

**Step 6: Push & Create PR**
```bash
git push origin feature/issue-XX-description
```
- Create Pull Request on GitHub
- Reference issue number in PR description
- Request code review

**Step 7: Post-Merge Cleanup**
```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete branches
git branch -d feature/issue-XX-description
git push origin --delete feature/issue-XX-description
```

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest
git fetch origin

# 2. Switch to main and pull
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3. Create feature branch (example for issue #45)
git checkout -b feature/issue-45-supabase-subscriptions-schema

# 4. Now start making changes
# ... make code changes ...

# 5. Run code quality checks before completion
npm run format                    # Auto-format code
git add .                         # Stage formatting changes
git commit -m "style: format code" # Commit formatting (only if changes made)
npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run build && npm test

# 6. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/issue-45-supabase-subscriptions-schema
```

### Important Rules

**✅ DO:**
- Always fetch and pull main before creating branch
- Always create a feature branch before making changes
- Reference issue number in branch name
- Use descriptive branch names
- Work only on feature branches

**❌ DON'T:**
- Work directly on `main` branch
- Create branch without pulling latest main first
- Skip fetching/pulling before creating branch
- Work without an associated issue

### When No Issue Exists

**If there's no issue to work on:**
1. Create an issue first describing the work
2. Then follow the workflow above

**Never start coding without:**
- An issue describing the problem/feature
- A feature branch created from latest main

### Summary

**Complete Issue Workflow:**
1. ✅ Fetch origin
2. ✅ Checkout main & pull latest
3. ✅ Create feature branch (with issue reference)
4. ✅ Start coding & make changes
5. ✅ Run quality checks (format, lint, build, tests)
6. ✅ Push branch & create PR
7. ✅ Post-merge cleanup

**Remember:** No work without an issue, no work on main!
